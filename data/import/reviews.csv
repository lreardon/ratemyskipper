He cares about his crew, is kindhearted and forgiving, and makes sure you eat well and get enough sleep. He's really interested in sharing what he knows, if you're really interested in learning.

The Shining Sea is a 38 foot Ledford, and for most of the season Chuck operates with just 2 crew, taking on a third for humpies in August. We fished mostly in shallow water along the coast. We would never wait in line, which usually meant we made lots of sets in a day, without much break. However, the pace of sets that we made was relatively slow. We alternated crew duties, taking turns in the skiff and on deck, stacking corks (we'd let leads fall).

Chuck has 40 years of experience, and is selective about when and where he'll fish. He doesn't fish as hard as many boats, and you likely won't earn as much as you might on a larger, more intense boat, but the overall experience was unique and rewarding.","2023-04-29 20:39:20.667627","2023-05-19 07:22:29.886788","signed_for_friends",True,True,False,True

He has no consideration for any of his crew, his temper is beyond short, and working for him feels more like a prison sentence than anything resembling a job. Every other word that comes out of his mouth is a lie, and he will withhold food from you if he feels youâ€™re eating too much. He is notorious for being one of the worst captains in Egegigik. Usually his crew will either quit or will be fired before the end of the season. Somehow I managed to make it through the season and he only paid me 6% of the promised 10% with no retro or chilled fish check afterwords. On a positive note, I left with a lot of funny stories.
